    You can restrict who can control Niles and the associated Google Calendar with roles.
    Niles will only allow one role to be used, and it must have a unique name.

    i.e. Create a role called *Scheduler*, and then tell Niles to only allow people with that role using `!admin Scheduler` (case sensitive)

    The admin role for this discord is {{allowedrole}}. You can change this setting using `!admin <ROLE>`, making sure to spell the role as you've created it.
    You must have this role to set it as the admin role.
    You can allow everyone to use Niles again by entering `!admin everyone`

    Hi! Lets get me setup for use in this Discord. The steps are outlined below, but for a detailed setup guide, visit https://nilesbot.com/start

    2. Enter the Calendar ID of the calendar to Discord using the `!id` command, i.e. `!id 123abc@123abc.com`

  I can't seem to find your calendar! This is usually because you haven't invited Niles to access your calendar, run `!setup` to make sure you followed Step 1.
