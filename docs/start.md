## Invite Niles to your server

[Invite Niles](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320434122344366082&scope=bot&permissions=523344){: .btn}

## Configure Google Calendar

Select or create a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com), and select 'Settings and sharing'
{: .pb-4 }

![gcalexample](../../assets/images/gcal-example-0.gif)
{: .text-center .pb-4 }

Scroll down and under 'Share with specific people', add `niles-291@niles-169605.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and give permissions to `Make changes to events`
{: .pb-4 }

## Add Google Calendar to your Niles Configuration

Still on the 'Settings and sharing' page, scroll down to 'Integrate Calendar' and copy the calendar ID.
{: .pb-4 }

![gcalidexample](../../assets/images/gcal-example-2.png)
{: .text-center .pb-4 }

Now in your Discord server (in a channel where Niles will have permissions, i.e. #general or another channel you have setup) we can use `!id` with the usage `!id calendarID` i.e:

`!id qb9t3fb6mn9p52a4re0hc067d8@group.calendar.google.com`

![discord-calendar-id-example](../../assets/images/discord-calendar-id.gif)
{: .text-center}

## Configure Timezone

We could pull this from your Google calendar or Discord server, but since your members might be in different timezones, you must add your own.

This can be done using `!tz` i.e.

`!tz America/New_York`
`!tz UTC+5`
`!tz EST`

![discord-tz-example](../../assets/images/discord-tz.gif)
{: .text-center}

## Run your calendar for the first time!

Great now we can tell Niles to pull events from our GCal, setting up the database and display our calendar.

`!display` - Displays the calendar WITHOUT deleting any messages.

Both methods pin the current calendar to the channel it was called in.

The calendar will automatically check for updates every 5 minutes, but you can manually use `!update` to pull any updates.

## Customise it

You can change the way Niles looks and behaves, depending on your needs. See the [detailed customisation documentation](../customisation).

## Warnings

### GSuite/Workplace
If Niles is unable to find your calendar and you are under a GSuite / Google Workplace account, it's possible that the administrator has limited external sharing.

Google has a help article on how to enable external sharing  
https://support.google.com/a/answer/60765?hl=en

### New Calendar Format
Google Calendar has a new format for calendar IDs  
eg. `CAL1_qb9t3fb6mn9p52a4re0hc067d8@group.calendar.google.com`

If your calendar isn't found, remove the `CAL1_` portion - everything before and including the underscore
